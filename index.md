## Software and Technology Consulting

Providing software development, systems administration, and networking services of the highest calibur at reasonable prices.

### Why choose me

I have over 20 years of industry experience and deep knowledge of many platforms and systems. There are few tasks I cannot accomplish.

### Rates

My base rate is $250/hr for development and $200/hr for IT/network consulting. You'll pay much less than an agency will charge you because I finish the job quickly and don't pad my hours.

### Estimates

Ballpark estimates are free for projects of low to medium complexity. If a detailed estimate is required, there will be a $50/hr charge for the time to consult with you and prepare the estimate.
